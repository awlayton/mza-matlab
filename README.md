# MZA MATLAB

This is a reimplementation of the Management Zone Analyst algorithm
in MATLAB.
Only the actual delineation (or classification) part of MZA is implemented.
I did this mainly for 2 reasons.

1. I could not get the actual MZA software to run in modern Windows.
2. I planned to just read the output file into MATLAB anyways.
